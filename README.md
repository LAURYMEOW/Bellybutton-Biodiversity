# Bellybutton Biodiversity

Improbable Beef is a company interested in generating synthetic meat based on bacteria that are produced in the human body, specifically in the navel. It is currently in research practices for which they selected a sample of volunteers to perform them bacterial cultures and detect those that have the conditions and quantities required by the company and be able to buy their cultures.
Roza and the volunteers need to visualize the bacterial data. On the website, volunteers can identify the top 10 bacterial species that live in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate for synthetic meat, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify if that species is in their belly button.
The page is quite dynamic and allows the volunteer to search for their ID to obtain their results immediately without problems.
